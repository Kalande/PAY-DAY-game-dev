# PAY-DAY GAME DEV
[PLAY PAY-DAY](https://kalande.github.io/PAY-DAY-game-dev/)


## Description
PAY-DAY is a 2D Platformer game with inspiration taken from Mario. You are a working man running through a busy metropolis with the added thrill of cars zooming by below you, let's not forget about your boss who's on your case about those assignments he gave you. Your goal is to collect those assignments and give them to your boss to progress. Use the platforms to get to where you need to go. Seems pretty easy right? Well...remember those cars? Try to avoid those too XD.
