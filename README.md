[Link Deploy](http://github.com)


## Description
PAY-DAY is a side-scroller game with inspiration taken from Mario and flappy bird. You are a working man running through city-life with expenses(cars) literally flying at you, let's not forget about your boss who's on your case about those assignments he gave you.  Your goal is to collect those assignments and give them to your boss to get paid. The more you get the higher your score. Seems pretty easy right? Well...remember those "expenses"? Try to avoid those too :D
